# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

For this application I created a note taker, in which you can save and delete your notes.

## Description

This is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

For this assignment I created the backend and connected it to the front end.
